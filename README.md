# Text-based Emotion Classifier

## Aim
### To identify the underlying emotions of a given text message. <br>
> Our project can be useful in the following scenario: <br>
> Â· Sentimental analysis of customer review. <br>

## Dataset 
#### Source of Dataset
> https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp by Praveen

#### Format of Dataset
> | text         | emotion |
> |--------------|---------|
> |i didnt feel humiliated | sadness |
> |i can go from feeling so hopeless to so damned hopeful just from being around... | sadness |
> |im grabbing a minute to post i feel greedy wrong | anger |
> |i am ever feeling nostalgic about the fireplace i will know that it is still... | love |

> **Note:** ***text*** and ***emotion*** are separated by a semi-colon ***';'***.

## Default Libraries
> The following libraries are used throughout the project. 

> [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) <br>
> [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) <br>
> [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial.html) <br>
> [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) <br>
> [Word Cloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) <br>
> [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.5.1/)<br>
> [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
>
> Note: `Word Cloud` has not received any official support for Python 3.xx. Thus, we used [Word Cloud *unofficial*](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#wordcloud) as our library instead. 

## Custom Libraries
> We have compiled a list of functions and classes which are useful during our project. These functions are repeatedly used within our project, and can be found in [Libraries](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/blob/main/Libraries.py). <br>
> 
> Please read [Libaries Information](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/blob/main/Libraries%20Information.md) for the details of the functions and classes found within our custom library.

## Updates
> For the progress of our project, please refer to [Updates](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/blob/main/Updates.md).

## Issues
### Issue on Jupyter Notebook (Ipynb files) and Github
> There appears to be a widespread issue ongoing on Github w.r.t the incorrect printing/inability to print outputs from Jupyter Notebook formatted files. <br> <br>
> **Replicable:** `Yes` <br>
> **Source of Issue:** Most likely `Github` <br>
> **Fixed:** `No` <br>
> **Comments:** Please use alternative IDE to inspect the main code sections. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) is known to be working properly.

## Overview
> Our code section is divided into `3` main portion: <br>
> * [Data Preparation](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/edit/main/README.md#data-preparation)
> * [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/edit/main/README.md#exploratory-data-analysis)
> * [Machine Learning](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/edit/main/README.md#machine-learning)

### Data Preparation
> In this section, we perform the necessary import of libraries, as well as our train dataset. We also performed simple analysis of our dataset to get a brief outlook of what kind of data we were dealing with. <br>
> 
> Please refer to [Text-based Emotion Classifier](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/blob/main/Text-based%20Emotion%20Classifier.Ipynb) for the details of our source code.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
> In this section, we perform mainly more in-depth analysis of our dataset. From the analysis, we figured out that our dataset requires some cleaning. Thus, we have performed dataset cleaning which can be classified into the following 3 phases:
> * Lemmatization of words
> * Removal of HTML tags and attributes
> * Removal of stopwords
> 
> We are mainly using the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) library as our de-facto dataset cleaning library. <br>
> 
> We are mainly using the [Word Cloud](https://pypi.org/project/wordcloud/) as our main data visualisation library. <br>
> 
> Please refer to [Text-based Emotion Classifier](https://github.com/Neo-Zenith/SC1015-GP/blob/main/Text-based%20Emotion%20Classifier.Ipynb) under `Exploratory Data Analysis` for the details of our source code.

### Machine Learning
> In this section, we perform machine learning by using the following 3 models on our train dataset:
> * Logisitc Regression
> * Naive Bayes Algorithm
> * Linear Support Vector Machine
> 
> We proceeded to apply our trained models on the validation dataset, and obtain their respective **Precision**, **Recall** and **F1-socre**. <br>
> 
> We further performed a **repeated k-fold cross validation check** on each model to determine the best model from the three. <br>
> 
> Finally we apply the best model we chose on the test dataset.
